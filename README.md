# COVID19 Classifier

Using a dataset coming from 2 hospitals in China, regrouping 75 biomarkers from blood samples of COVID19 infected patients, we preprocessed the data and compared the outcome of different machine learning algorithms to obtain a classifier that could predict whether a patient was infected or not with the highest accuracy and at the earliest.
